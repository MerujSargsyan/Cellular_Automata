# CONWAYS GAME OF LIFE

### Basic implementation of the game of life defined by John Conway

## Usage: (CMake >3.0 required)

Clone repo and simply run
```bash
make
```

Then to run the project, run
```bash
make run
```
### Click the B button to brush your custom cells (or leave empty for random generation)
#### Click "Start" to start the simulation
#### "Pause" button pauses the current simulation and "Stop" button resets it to start a new one

## What I learned:
<ul>
<li> Drawing/Game loop Manipulation</li>
<li> Making simple UI in C using raylib</li>
</ul>

### I plan to do more with this project but it was quick and fun to make
